The '''Unofficial JavaDocs''' from '''quarantin''' aims to document the Java code of [[Project Zomboid]] for [[Build 41]] in a way similar to the official JavaDocs. It is intended to be used by modders to understand the available classes, methods, and fields in the game [[Lua (API)|Java]] code. It should not be confused with the [[Unofficial JavaDocs (Build 42)|unofficial JavaDocs]] for [[Build 41]] by [[User:Albion|Albion]].
