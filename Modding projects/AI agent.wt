This project introduces an '''AI agent''' that operates entirely '''locally''' within Project Zomboid, without requiring external servers, APIs, or cloud processing. The AI autonomously perceives, decides, and acts in real-time, with the first demo featuring a model of ''The Walking Dead's Rick Grimes'' surviving in PZ.

==Key Features & Innovations==

===Game-State Perception===
The AI understands the game world using visual, audio, and internal game state signals to develop situational awareness.  

===Domain-Specific Game Knowledge===
The AI is trained on 10,000+ wiki pages and community discussions, fine-tuned with reinforcement learning, allowing it to behave like a PZ expert.  

===Multi-Agent Collaboration===
AI agents interact naturally in teams, forming social dynamics, survival strategies, and emergent story arcs—e.g., recreating Rick’s early group from ''The Walking Dead''.  

===Local Text-to-Speech (TTS)===  
Custom lightweight voice models generate NPC dialogue without cloud-based synthesis, giving each character a unique voice.  

==Why Project Zomboid?==
The developers chose PZ due to its complex survival mechanics, making it an ideal testbed for AI-driven gameplay. The project aims to push the boundaries of AI-driven storytelling, emergent gameplay, and multi-agent collaboration.  

==Future Goals==  
*Expanding research into small-model AI agents for game development.  
*Supporting indie developers in integrating AI-powered characters into games.  
*Exploring AI-driven game design innovations beyond PZ.
