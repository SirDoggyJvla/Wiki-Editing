The '''Building Pool''' provided by okkydoo is a bank of building files which can be used by the community in their own maps, as long as they are credited. As of may 2024, the Building Pool V4 contains 102 buildings. It serves as a sort of standalone continuation of the [[Building Pool (Blackbeard)|Building Pool by Blackbeard]].
