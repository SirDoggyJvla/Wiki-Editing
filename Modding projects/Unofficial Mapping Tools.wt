The '''Unofficial Mapping Tools''' is a project by Unjammer which aims to provide an alternative to the official Project Zomboid mapping tools as well as providing features needed for [[Build 42]] mapping. The tools are packaged from a fork of [[TileZed]] and [[WorldEd]]. One key feature is that it doesn't rely on Windows registry or a folder in {{Code|%userprofile%}}, allowing multiple versions of the tools on the same computer. A version of the tools for [[Build 41]] is also available.

Other features include:
*A dark mode by default alongside a new theme management system, to create your own themes with the use of QSS themes.
*Improves visibility of tiles and their names.
*The Tiles Unpacker now includes advanced options beyond just prefix handling.
*Road and full buildings generation and fixed built-in Lua engine for the InGameMap.
*Thumbnail up to 8192 pixels.
*Biomemap generator based on two images ({{Code|Main}} and {{Code|_veg}}). Includes automatic tile splitting.
*Support for [[Build 42]] features such as basements, animals, WorldGen etc.
*Includes the game tilesheets.
*And more...
