'''[https://github.com/demiurgeQuantified/PZEventDoc PZEventDoc]''' is a tool for generating Lua annotations for Project Zomboid events and hooks from a JSON specification to allow for autocompletion, type checking and easy access to documentation. Most modders will only be interested in the output files ([https://github.com/demiurgeQuantified/PZEventDoc/blob/develop/docs/Events.md Events documentation] or [[PZEventStubs]]).

Its database was used to generate the updated list of [[Lua events]] on the wiki.
