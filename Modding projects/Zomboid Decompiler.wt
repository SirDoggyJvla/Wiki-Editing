'''Zomboid Decompiler''' is a tool specifically designed to decompile Project Zomboid's code. It can be used to decompile both [[Build 41]] and [[Build 42]] game code. It is currently the best available option as it will take into account the [[Java documentation]] of the game and will format the code in a way that is easier to read.

You will need:
*[[Decompiling game code#Java|Java]] 17 or above.
*The [https://github.com/demiurgeQuantified/ZomboidDecompiler/releases latest] release of the tool.

To decompile the game code, extra the zip, navigate to the {{Code|bin}} folder. To launch the decompiler, run {{Code|ZomboidDecompiler.bat}} on Windows or {{Code|ZomboidDecompiler}} on non-Windows OS. It will automatically find your game files and have the game installed on Steam and create two folders called {{Code|output/}} with the decompiled code and {{Code|logs/}}.

Alternatively, if you are having issues decompiling, you can launch it from a command line directly from the file folder:
*On Windows:
{{CodeSnip
| lang = bash
| code =
ZomboidDecompiler.bat "<path/to/your/ProjectZomboid/folder>"
}}
*On Linux:
{{CodeSnip
| lang = bash
| code =
./ZomboidDecompiler "<path/to/your/ProjectZomboid/folder>"
}}

{{Note|Use the <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> argument to get information about the command line parameters.}}

==Remapping==
{{Main|Remote debugging}}
Zomboid Decompiler allows for remote debugging by remapping the game files. To do so, you need to decompile the game code with a specific option which is going to remap the lines of the game code to match the decompiled version:
*On Windows:
{{CodeSnip
| lang = bash
| code =
ZomboidDecompiler.bat "<path/to/your/ProjectZomboid/folder>" --remap-line-numbers
}}
*On Linux:
{{CodeSnip
| lang = bash
| code =
./ZomboidDecompiler "<path/to/your/ProjectZomboid/folder>" --remap-line-numbers
}}

See [[Remote debugging]] for more information on how to set up remote debugging.

{{Note|type=warn|This will modify the game files and thus needs to be done everytime the game is updated.}}
