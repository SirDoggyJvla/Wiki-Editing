{{Header|PZwiki}}
'''{{Abbr|Mboxes|Message boxes}}''' are used to inform a reader or editor about something related to the article. Any issues can be fixed by anyone, otherwise they can contribute to the discussion.

Mboxes should be directly above the content to which they're referring. So, for an entire article, place them above the infobox if there is one; or for a section, place them beneath the heading.
