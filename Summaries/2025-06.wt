Hello everyone, new modding summary from me, Sir Doggy Jvla. I've been quite busy with real life lately, so my activity has been a bit reduced overall.

Individual pages for the [[Unofficial Modding Discord]] and [[Unofficial Mapping Discord]] were created under [[Modding projects]] to better document what these communities are about. Below is the number of people who joined via the wiki Discord invites:
*[[Unofficial Modding Discord]]: 665 joined since the creation of the invite (\~December). (574 in May)
*[[Unofficial Mapping Discord]]: 179 joined since the creation of the invite (\~December). (97 in May)

The mapping tools now have their own dedicated pages: [[WorldEd]], [[TileZed]] (updated), [[BuildingEd]], and [[Unofficial Mapping Tools]]. The [[Mapping]] page was also overhauled to reflect up-to-date information and now links to all relevant mapping resources on the wiki. I also created a [[File:Mapping tools - diagram.png|graphic]] to visually represent the mapping tools hierarchy.

Additionally, the official [[Project Zomboid Modding Tools|Modding Tools]] now have their own page, aligning with the expanded mapping documentation.

Still on mapping: the [[pzmap2dzi]] tool now has its own page, and a new wiki project, [[B42 Map]], was launched with the goal of providing an interactive online map for [[Build 42]].

The [[Lua (API)]] section saw a great new addition with the creation of [[LuaDocs]], a [[modding projects|modding project]] by [[User:Albion|Albion]] that functions similarly to [[JavaDocs]] but for Lua functions and objects. Additionally, individual pages were made for both the [[Unofficial JavaDocs (Build 41)]] and [[Unofficial JavaDocs (Build 42)]], as they are distinct projects created by different contributors and require separate documentation.

The former "ModData" page has been renamed to [[Mod data]], now covering both global and object mod data. These topics share the same underlying mechanisms, so merging them helps reduce redundancy across the wiki. The [[Lua event]] page was also greatly simplified, since the event listings are now automatically handled by wiki categories, reducing future maintenance.

Rainmaker released a video tutorial on creating a new item in the game, which has been added to the [[Modding]] page. Speaking of the [[Modding]] page, the tutorials and resources section has been significantly restructured. Guides have been moved to their relevant field-specific pages, with most mapping-related tutorials now under the revamped [[Mapping]] section.

On the [[Scripts|scripting]] side, the [[TimedAction (scripts)]] page was created to document this script type, along with a new parameter category: [[:Category:TimedAction parameters]]. The [[TimedAction (craftRecipe)]] page now specifically documents the `craftRecipe` parameter that uses [[TimedAction (scripts)]]. (Yes, it's confusing — blame the game's naming conventions.)

The modeling and animation section of the [[File formats]] page was streamlined for clarity. The [[ZomboidAssetConverter]] tool now has its own dedicated page for proper documentation.

Several line-by-line guide pages were renamed for consistency, following naming patterns like [[Creating a clothing mod]] and [[Creating custom animations]]. These pages were moved to [[:Category:Modding guides]], along with other instructional pages, even if they're not strict walkthroughs.

[[Animation]] now has its own page, and each rig has been given its own [[modding project]] page: [[Mystery rig]], [[Paddlefruit rig]], [[Dislaik rig]], [[Throttlekitty rig]]. [[AnimNodes]] are now partially documented, though still incomplete.

Other minor additions or changes that don't warrant full paragraphs:

*New [[Modding projects]] pages not yet mentioned — [[Pythoid]], [[Real Life Map]], [[Moodle Framework]], [[Moodles in lua]], [[Map Mover]], [[Zombie Layer Replacer]], [[PZTools]], [[Azakaela's Modding Tools]].
*[[Azakaela's Modding Tools]] — a suite of tools by Azakaela that were previously lost due to broken download links — have been recovered. After contacting the author and receiving permission, I created an [https://github.com/SirDoggyJvla/Archive.Azakaela-s-Modding-Tools archive] of them. However the source code of those was lost.
*Similarly, as part of the resource reorganization on [[Modding]], I archived several modding resources that were previously scattered across Discord via this [https://github.com/SirDoggyJvla/Archive.Project-Zomboid-Modding archive].
*Discussions with the mapping community were held to find better archiving solutions for their resources. While no solution has been finalized yet, I hope proper long-term preservation methods will be adopted.
*Due to a persistent issue, I've been unable to move pages myself and had to rely on wiki admins to handle renames. As of last week, the problem still persists.

Thanks to the various users contributing to the wiki:

*[[User:Albion|Albion]] — for maintaining her own [[Starlit Library]], correcting various pages, and offering her invaluable modding insights across the wiki.
*[[User:Aoqia|Aoqia]] — for updates to [[ZomboidAssetConverter]], [[Remote debugging]], and wording improvements to [[Beautiful Java]].
*[[User:Dhert|Dhert]] — for creating the [[AnimAPI]] page (initially meant as a subpage to [[Community Modding Projects]]). However, due to the nature of the [[Modding projects]], technical documentation for tools will instead be moved to the GitHub wiki.
*[[User:Imnotpolar|Imnotpolar]] — for wording fixes in the [[Debug mode]] page.
*And of course, the wiki admins, who continually clean up formatting, typos, and issues we miss.
