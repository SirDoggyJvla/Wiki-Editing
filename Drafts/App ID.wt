The {{Code|App ID}} is a unique identifier for a game or application on the Steam platform. It is used to manage and reference the game within the Steam ecosystem, including for server management and modding purposes.

To find this ID, you can:
*Check the URL of the game on the Steam store. The ID is the number in the URL. For example, for Project Zomboid, the URL is ''https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/'', and so the App ID is ''108600''.
