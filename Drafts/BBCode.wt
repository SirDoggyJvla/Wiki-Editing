'''[[Wikipedia:BBCode|BBCode]]''' is a form of markup language used to format posts in many message boards and forums. It allows users to add elements like bold text, italics, links, and images to their messages using a simple tag-based syntax. It can be recognized by its use of square brackets to enclose tags, such as `[b]` for bold text. It is used by [[Steam]] to format posts in the Steam Community.
