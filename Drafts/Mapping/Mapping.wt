'''Mapping''' in Project Zomboid consist of creating new maps which are either standalone to the vanilla [[Knox Country]] or directly inserted inside it. This is done by creating a new map cell, which is a 300x300 tile area in [[Build 41]] and 256x256 in [[Build 42]]. Replacing an existing cell is done by overriding the existing one, which means that the entire cell must be replaced, including its terrain data and any structures within it. This means it is not possible to simply place a single building in an existing cell without remaking all the surrounding buildings as well.

You can access a full view render of the [[Knox Country]] map via the [[Project Zomboid Map Project]].

==Mapping tools==
Official tools exist for mapping but at the moment are not available for [[Build 42]] yet. They are available in the [[Project Zomboid Modding Tools]] on Steam but are outdated. You can access them from the latest uploaded version on the [https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/59675-latest-tilezed-worlded-and-tilesets-september-8-2022/ Project Zomboid forum]. Below are each mapping tools available for Project Zomboid:
*[[WorldEd]] - The main tool for creating maps.
*[[TileZed]] - Included in WorldEd, used to create and edit tilesets as well as edit maps.

The [[Unofficial Mapping Tools]] aims to provide the updated mapping tools for [[Build 42]], allowing the creation of basements. The picture below details the mapping tools hierarchy:

Erika from [[The Indie Stone]] stated work is being done to update the official mapping tools for [[Build 42]] and will be released on stable:
{{Quote|author=Erika in [https://discord.com/channels/136501320340209664/279303619277488128/1423997542009405451 the official Discord] - October 2025|text=Hello ðŸ™‚ Just wanted to give you a small update about the tools. We are currently at work on B42 unstable. The official B42 tools will be released when we release B42 stable. We will share them as soon as we can, right now I can't give a timeline for when it's ready.}}

==Folder structure==
{{Main|Mod structure}}
[[File:Mod structure - maps.webp|thumb]]
The <code>maps</code> folder in <code>media</code> is used to store map files. It's subfolder will correspond to a map and its associated files which are obtained by exporting a map from the mapping tools.
{{CodeSnip
| code =
media/
â””â”€â”€ maps/
    â””â”€â”€ MyMap/
        â”œâ”€â”€ maps/
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
        â”œâ”€â”€ X_Y.lotheader
        â”œâ”€â”€ chunkdata_X_Y.bin
        â”œâ”€â”€ map.info
        â”œâ”€â”€ objects.lua
        â”œâ”€â”€ spawnpoints.lua
        â”œâ”€â”€ thumb.png
        â”œâ”€â”€ worldmap-forest.xml
        â”œâ”€â”€ worldmap.xml
        â”œâ”€â”€ world_X_Y.lotpack
        â””â”€â”€ ...
}}

<code>MyMap</code> will need to be a unique name associated with your map but the map informations are mostly defined the [[map.info]] file. Other files are used to define spawnpoints as well as the biomes, chunks, streetnames etc.

==Building pools==
[[The Indie Stone]] and the community have created several building pools, which are collections of buildings that can be used in custom maps. These pools can be used as a reference or directly in your own maps, as long as you credit the original authors when asked for credit. Below is the list of available building pools:
*[[Building Pool (official)]]
*[[Building Pool (Blackbeard)]]
*[[Building Pool (okkydoo)]]
*[[Building Pool (Dylan)]]
*[[Community Architect]]

==Public maps==
Some maps created by the community had their files made public for other mappers to use or study. Below is a list of public maps, their authors as well as how they can be used:
