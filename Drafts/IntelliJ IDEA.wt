{{Main|Remote debugging}}
To setup [[remote debugging]] with IntelliJ IDEA, you need to set up a remote debugging configuration. This allows you to connect to the game process and debug it remotely. Follow the steps below to set up remote debugging in IntelliJ IDEA:
*Open IntelliJ IDEA and open the [[Decompiling game code|decompiled game code]] as a project.
*Top right corner, click ''"Current file"'' to open a dropdown menu. This might be something else if you used it already, it should be next to a play button, a green bug button and a three vertical dots button.
*Open ''"Edit Configurations..."''.
*Click the ''"+"'' button to add a new configuration (top left).
*Select ''"Remote JVM Debug"'' from the list.
*In the ''"Name"'' field, enter a name for the configuration (e.g. ''"Project Zomboid Remote Debug"'' or ''"Attach to PZ"''), this is just for your reference.
*The other fields should already be set correctly. If you are having issues, check the following:
**''Transport'' is set to ''Socket''
**''Host'' is set to ''localhost''
**''Port'' is set to ''5005''
*Click ''"OK"'' to save the configuration.

To start remote debugging, you need to start the game with the remote debugging options enabled. You can do this by adding the following JVM argument to the game launch options:
