'''SteamCMD''' is a command-line version of the [[Steam]] client, designed for installing and updating dedicated servers for games. It can be used to download and manage game files without the need for a graphical interface, as well as installing or uploading Workshop mods. Regular users do not need to use SteamCMD, and it is primarily intended for server administrators and modders.

The official Valve documentation provides detailed instructions on how to setup SteamCMD. However, the documentation regarding details on how to use it is lacking.

==Connecting to SteamCMD==
{{Unverified|How long does the cache credential lasts and can it be changed ?}}
After installing SteamCMD, you can connect to it by running the command <code>steamcmd</code> in a terminal or command prompt. This will start the SteamCMD client and display a custom command prompt where you can enter commands. Actions which do not require an account like download a Workshop item can be done anonymously, while actions that require an account, such as uploading a Workshop item, will require you to log in.

To login anonymously, use the command <code>login anonymous</code>. To login with your Steam account, use the command <code>login {{CodeSnip/param|username}}</code> then enter your password. Your credentials will be cached for some time, allowing you to login back in without giving your password.

==Uploading Workshop items==
To upload or create a new workshop item, you need to create a build configuration file. SteamCMD uses this file to get the informations about the workshop item you want to upload. Such a file needs to follow a specific format:
{{CodeSnip
| code =
"workshopitem"
{
	"appid"		"108600"
	"publishedfileid"		"3525515977"
	"contentfolder"		"<path to content to upload>"
	"previewfile"		"<path to preview image file>"
	"visibility"		"0"
	"title"		"Test SteamCMD upload"
	"description"		"Test SteamCMD upload"
	"changenote"		"Test SteamCMD upload: This is a test"
}
}}

The format of the file doesn't matter but these files are usually refered to as [https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VDF VDF files (Valve Data File)]. To upload the item using the newly created build configuration file, use the command:
{{CodeSnip/custom|code=
workshop_build_item {{CodeSnip/param|2=path/to/build/file}}
}}

{| class="wikitable theme-blue"
|+ style="white-space:nowrap" | List of parameters
! Parameter name !! Description
|-
| style="padding: 10px;"| <big><code>appid</code></big>
| style="padding: 5px;"| The App ID of the game for which you are uploading the workshop item. For Project Zomboid, this is always <code>108600</code>.
|-
| style="padding: 10px;"| <big><code>publishedfileid</code></big>
| style="padding: 5px;"| The unique identifier for the workshop item. This number can easily be found for an existing Workshop item in the URL of the item page, but it is also automatically added to the description when using the [[Uploading mods#In-game uploader|in-game uploader]].

{{Note|To create a new workshop item, simply set this to <code>0</code> or remove the <code>publishedfileid</code> line. SteamCMD will create a new item with a new ID and replace or add this value with the new ID in the build file after the upload for future uploads.}}
|-
| style="padding: 10px;"| <big><code>contentfolder</code></big>
| style="padding: 5px;"| The path to the folder containing the content of the workshop item. This folder should contain all the files that you want to include in the workshop item. For Project Zomboid, this folder should be {{Code|Workshop/<mod folder>/Contents/mods/}} if you take the default [[mod structure]].
|-
| style="padding: 10px;"| <big><code>previewfile</code></big>
| style="padding: 5px;"| The path to the preview image file for the workshop item. This file will be displayed as the thumbnail for the item in the Workshop. It can be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file.
|-
| style="padding: 10px;"| <big><code>visibility</code></big>
| style="padding: 5px;"| The visibility of the workshop item. It can be set to:
*<code>0</code> for public visibility (default),
*<code>1</code> for friends-only visibility,
*<code>2</code> for private (hidden) visibility.
*<code>3</code> for unlisted visibility.
|-
| style="padding: 10px;"| <big><code>title</code></big>
| style="padding: 5px;"| The title of the workshop item. This is the name that will be displayed in the Workshop.
|-
| style="padding: 10px;"| <big><code>description</code></big>
| style="padding: 5px;"| The description of the workshop item. This can be a multiline text in the configuration file, for example:
{{CodeSnip
| code =
"workshopitem"
{
	"appid"		"108600"
	"publishedfileid"		"3525515977"
	"contentfolder"		"<path to content to upload>"
	"previewfile"		"<path to preview image file>"
	"visibility"		"0"
	"title"		"Test SteamCMD upload"
	"description"		"Test SteamCMD upload
This is a multiline description

	"changenote"		"Test SteamCMD upload: Added build file to content"
}
}}
|-
| style="padding: 10px;"| <big><code>changenote</code></big>
| style="padding: 5px;"| The change note for the workshop item. Like for the description, this can be a multiline text in the configuration file.
|}

You can find a simple workshop item example uploaded with this method [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3525515977 here]. In this example, a gif was uploaded as the preview image, which isn't possible with the [[Uploading mods#In-game uploader|in-game uploader]].

{{Note|1=The description and patch note use [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2807121939 Steam BBCode].}}

==Retrieving a workshop item information==
You can retrieve a Workshop item informations by using a [[Wikipedia:POST (HTTP)|POST request]] from the [https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamRemoteStorage#GetPublishedFileDetails Steam API]:
{{CodeSnip
| lang = bash
| code =
curl -X POST "https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamRemoteStorage/GetPublishedFileDetails/v1/" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "itemcount=1" -d "publishedfileids[0]=<publishedfileid>"
}}
